For this purpose the app uses your microphone to access the input audio stream. As an alternative audio source it can also access the audio stream send to your Apple AirPods. In both cases the audiostream is converted into a signature. The signature is a compressed version of the audio stream but it cannot be converted back to the audiostream. The signature can be compared to the known signature of music titles. For that purpose the signature is transferred to the Shazam servers. They try to match your signature with the signature of all the songs in there database. If they find a match, they respond with the song information which includes title, artist, album, release year and the URL of the related coverart. The app then loads the cover art from the URL if available and displays information of the matched song.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://musicuncovered.github.io/about/about</guid><title>About</title><description></description><link>https://musicuncovered.github.io/about/about</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 21:07:04 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>About</h1><p>All about <strong>Music Uncovered</strong></p><p><strong>Music Uncovered</strong> is an app that listen to music around you and presents cover and song information in a fullscreen view which is updated automatically with each new song.
